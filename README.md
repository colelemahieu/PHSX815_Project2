#### Step 1

Generate fair and unfair dice rolls using "DiceRollFair.py" and "DiceRoll.py" respectively. For both files, number of rolls and number of experiments can be specified from the command line using "-Nroll " and "-Nexp ". For example: "python DiceRoll.py -Nroll 10 -Nexp 12". Please pipe these results to .txt files.
